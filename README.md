This is a demo project for **Nutiteq 3D Android mapping SDK 2.x version**. 

NB! This sample is for **older Nutiteq SDK 2.x only**, for the latest Nutiteq maps SDK 3.x for Android go to  https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d-android project instead. For new app projects we suggest to start with 3.0 version now, not this older version.

# Usage
To get started see [project Wiki pages](https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d/wiki). It shows how to create a map and add layers on top of that.
