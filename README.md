This is a demo project for **Nutiteq 3D Android mapping SDK**. Nutiteq SDK is a replacement for Google Maps API (MapView) for Android, so it has all your usual mapping SDK features (map panning, vector/raster overlays etc) plus some extras: 
* 2.5/3D view: map tilting, rotating and 3D models
* offline mapping (MBTiles, persistent caching etc)
* supports any map projection, which makes it more usable for GIS apps

# Usage
To get started see [project Wiki pages](https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d/wiki). It shows how to create a map and add layers on top of that.
